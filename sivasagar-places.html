    <h2><strong>Exploring Sivasagar Assam</strong></h2>

    <!-- Description of Sivasagar -->
    <p>Sivasagar, a historical town in Assam, is renowned for its rich cultural heritage and the majestic monuments of the Ahom dynasty. Once the capital of the Ahom Kingdom, Sivasagar’s tranquil landscapes, temples, and palaces reflect the grandeur of Ahom architecture and history. The town’s name translates to "Ocean of Shiva."</p>
    <p>Also spelled and pronounced as Shibsagar, the town is steeped in history. While the temples are its main attraction, Shibsagar also boasts ancient monuments that captivate travelers. These architectural wonders, central to Assam's history, showcase the splendor of Ahom design. The Ahom dynasty ruled the Upper Assam region for nearly 600 years, leaving a lasting legacy in areas like Shivasagar, Golaghat, and Jorhat.</p>
    <p>The remnants of this powerful dynasty can still be found around present-day Sivasagar, which was once their capital. Some of Assam's most notable monuments are situated here. Over the centuries, the Ahoms assimilated with the local populace, adopting their customs and traditions. The monuments of Shibsagar can be classified into two categories: the religious temples or “Dol,” and secular structures like palaces, tanks, and maidans.</p>

    <!-- Description of the Ahoms -->
    <h3>The Ahoms</h3>
    <p> The Tai-AHOM are an ethnic group in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The leader was called Sukaphaa, and he established the Ahom Kingdom in 1228, centred around modern Assam until 1826, which is almost 598 years. In today’s era, the Ahom tribe are primarily found in the region around Jorhat, Sivasagar, Tinsukia and Lakhimpur. The Ahoms did not try to destroy the existing culture when they set up their kingdom and were expanding it. They added to the current culture and made it more prosperous by being a part of it.</p>
